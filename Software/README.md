The 'GUIAsyncTest.py' file MUST be run in a directory with the GUI screen elements:
-Home.ui
-clock2 (2).png
-battery.png
-heart.png
-clock2.png
-resources.qrc

Failure to launch the file in the same directory as the aforementioned elements will result in undefined behavior
	and may not work as intended.  This README was generated on 22-Jan 2022 and is intended for use
	with the code files included in the Ataraxia Google Drive at the following path:
