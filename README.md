# NASA-SAFE-T-Beacon
## Introduction
This project was developed by Ataraxia is the SAR (Search and Rescue) Assisting Frequency-modulating Electronic Transceiver - known professionally as SAFE-T, for short. This device is essentially a handheld beacon that will assist NASA with Lunar Search and Rescue operations by transmitting position, navigation, and time (PNT) information to the appropriate parties. 

The Ataraxia team consists of Vatsal Modgil, Falak Fahim, Peyton Goodman, and Gabrielle Quemada. Dr. Joseph Morgan was the faculty advisor overseeing the project, which was sponsored by Matt Leonard, the President of T STAR. The beacon prototype was designed at the request of NASA, to be further developed by the Lunar Search and Rescue program to be used by astronauts in 2024. 

## Background and Rationale
The background of SAFE-T stems from NASAâ€™s plan to return to the moon under the Artemis missions in 2024. With the Artemis program, NASA will establish a sustained presence on the Moon, opening more of the lunar surface to exploration than ever before. Currently, there is no adequate means of cislunar and lunar surface distress tracking coupled with a notification system, which will be a key element of safe exploration. Thus, the need for a mobile beacon arises. 

The intention is for SAFE-T to serve this purpose, as well as be capable of attaching to the Gandalf Staff - another project under development by several other ETID Capstone teams. The Gandalf Staff will be utilized in the upcoming years as a handheld extra-vehicular activity tool capable of lighting and remote imaging, and Ataraxia providing an automated distress tracking and notification system for the staff will only benefit the safety of lunar surface users.
